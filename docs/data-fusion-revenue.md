# CEB Revenue Data Fusion

This document describes how UN CEB revenue data from multiple source files is fused into a unified contributor breakdown.

## Source Files

| File | Coverage | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `revenue.csv` | 2011-2024 | Total revenue by entity × year × financing instrument |
| `revenue_government_donors.csv` | 2013-2024 | Government donor breakdown with specific country names |
| `revenue_non_gov_donors.csv` | 2009-2024 | Non-government donor breakdown (partial coverage) |
| `revenue_contrib_type.csv` | 2021-2024 | Revenue by contributor type (Government, EU, Foundations, etc.) |

## Fusion Methodology

### Tier 1: Basic Fusion (2013-2020)

For each entity and year:

1. **Government donors**: Specific country names from `revenue_government_donors.csv`
2. **Non-government donors**: Specific donors from `revenue_non_gov_donors.csv` with category when available
3. **Other (Unattributed)**: `Total Revenue - Government - NonGov` (single bucket, 10-20% of total)

### Tier 2: Full Category Breakdown (2021-2024)

For years where `contrib_type.csv` exists, the "Other" is broken down by contributor type:

1. **Government donors**: Specific country names (same as Tier 1)
2. **Non-government donors**: Specific donors grouped by C-code category
3. **"Other {Category}"**: For each category, calculated as `Category Total - Specific Donors in Category`

| Code | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| C01 | Government | Government contributions |
| C02 | NGOs | Non-governmental organizations |
| C04A | Multilateral - IFIs | International Financial Institutions |
| C04B | Multilateral - Global Funds | GEF, Global Fund, GAVI |
| C04C | Multilateral - UN Orgs | UN organizations excluding pooled funds |
| C04D | Multilateral - UN Pooled Funds | UN inter-agency pooled funds |
| C04E | Multilateral - Other | Other multilateral institutions |
| C05 | Foundations | Philanthropic foundations (e.g., Gates Foundation) |
| C06 | Private Sector | Corporate donors |
| C07 | Academic | Academic, training and research institutions |
| C08A | European Union | EU and European Commission |
| C08B | Other Contributors | Unclassified (correction bucket, use with caution) |
| C09 | No Contributor | Revenue from activities (interest, FX gains) |

**Example (2023 Foundations):**
- Category total from `contrib_type.csv`: $890M
- Gates Foundation from `nongov_donors.csv`: $460M
- "Other Foundations": $430M (calculated remainder)

## Output Schema

File: `data/ceb/fused/revenue_by_contributor.csv`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `entity` | UN entity (e.g., UNICEF, WHO, UNDP) |
| `year` | Calendar year |
| `contrib_code` | C-code (C01-C09) or "Other"/"Unknown" for Tier 1 years |
| `donor_type` | Category name (Government, Foundations, etc.) |
| `donor_name` | Specific donor name or "Other {Category}" |
| `amount` | Amount in USD |
| `is_other` | True if calculated remainder (not a specific named donor) |

## Known Limitations

### Data Quality Issues

1. **C08B "Other Contributors"**: Has 85% negative-to-positive ratio across years. This category appears to be used as a correction/adjustment bucket. Use with caution.

2. **Entity naming inconsistencies**: Some entities have different names across files (e.g., "UN Tourism" vs "UNWTO"). IRMCT is missing from some files.

3. **Negative amounts**: Legitimate accounting entries from audited statements including FX losses, refunds, and prior-period corrections. Approximately 1-2B/year in negative entries across all categories.

### Coverage Gaps

- Pre-2013: No government donor breakdown available
- Pre-2021: No contributor type breakdown (C-codes) available
- Non-gov donors file only covers major institutional donors, not all private/foundation contributions

## Validation

**Tier 1 (2013-2020):** Fused total matches `revenue.csv` within 0.1%. "Other" is 10-20% of total.

**Tier 2 (2021-2024):** "Other" is broken into 13 categories:

```
2023 "Other" breakdown:
  No Contributor:           3.94B  (revenue from activities)
  Private Sector:           2.50B
  Multilateral - UN Orgs:   1.62B
  Multilateral - Global Funds: 0.74B
  NGOs:                     0.66B
  Foundations:              0.43B
  ...
  TOTAL Other:             10.74B
```

**Note:** 2024 `contrib_type.csv` is incomplete (~1.75% gap vs `revenue.csv`).

## Data Sources

All source data comes from the [UN CEB Financial Statistics](https://unsceb.org/financial-statistics) database, which collects data from 43 UN entities annually. Figures are validated against audited financial statements.

The data standards are documented in the [UN Data Cube](https://unsceb.org/data-standards-united-nations-system-wide-reporting-financial-data) initiative.
