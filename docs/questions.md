# Questions

- Why is the Secretariat _spending_ data broken down by _source type_?
- Why do we not have Secretariat _revenue_ data? Since we have the source type it seems that this is being tracked, and then we should also have the breakdown by donor; as well as the breakdown by entity in the first place.
- Why do UNEP, UNODC, UN-Habitat, ITC have their own CEB entries, while the other Secretariat entities are all lumped together?
- Why are there non-government donors with assessed core contributions?
