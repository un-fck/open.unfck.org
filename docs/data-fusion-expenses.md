# UN Secretariat Expenses Data Fusion

This document explains how CEB and Secretariat expenses data are combined to provide granular breakdowns.

## Data Sources

### CEB Expenses (Primary)
`data/ceb/clean/expenses_sub_agency.csv` - 49 entities, 2011-2024

The CEB reports aggregate figures where:
- "UN" includes 70+ secretariat sub-entities
- "UN-DPO" includes all peacekeeping missions

### Secretariat Expenses (Supplementary)
`data/un-secretariat-expenses.csv` - 153 sub-entities, 2019-2023

Provides breakdown of UN and UN-DPO into constituent parts (OCHA, DPPA, DSS, peacekeeping missions, etc.).

## Entity Overlap Analysis

Five entities appear in both CEB and Secretariat data:

| Entity | CEB | Sec Assessed | Sec Voluntary | Relationship | Resolution |
|--------|-----|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| UNEP | $672M | $21M | $672M | CEB = voluntary only | Add assessed |
| UNODC | $440M | $24M | $417M | CEB ≈ voluntary | Add assessed |
| ITC | $159M | $20M | $115M | CEB includes WTO | CEB only |
| UNHCR | $5,320M | $45M | — | Assessed is 0.8% subset | CEB only |
| UNRWA | $1,461M | $38M | — | Assessed is 2.6% subset | CEB only |

**Rationale:**
- UNEP/UNODC: "Secretariat programmes" - CEB reports voluntary only, assessed contributions from UN regular budget are additional
- UNHCR/UNRWA: "Subsidiary organs" - have autonomous budgets, CEB includes the regular budget subvention
- ITC: Joint UN/WTO entity - CEB captures the complete picture

## Fusion Methodology

### Tier 1: CEB Only (2011-2018, 2024)
For years without secretariat data, use CEB entities as-is.

### Tier 2: CEB + Secretariat (2019-2023)
1. Remove "UN" and "UN-DPO" aggregates from CEB
2. Add all secretariat sub-entities except overlap entities (ITC, UNHCR, UNRWA)
3. Add secretariat assessed amounts for UNEP/UNODC (additive to CEB)

## Output

`data/ceb/fused/expenses.csv`:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| year | Calendar year (2011-2024) |
| entity | Entity code |
| amount | Expenses in USD |
| source | "ceb", "secretariat", or "secretariat_assessed" |

## Validation Results

```
2011-2018: CEB only, 34-42 entities, $41-53B
2019-2023: Fused, 179-189 entities, $54-67B
2024: CEB only, 48 entities, $66B
```

## CEB vs Secretariat Totals

Fusion years show slightly lower totals than CEB aggregates. This is expected:

- **CEB data**: Aggregates individual entity financial statements *without adjusting for inter-agency transfers*. When Entity A transfers funds to Entity B, both report the transaction, resulting in double-counting.

- **Secretariat data**: Consolidated financial statements that *eliminate inter-entity transfers* (standard consolidated accounting). This produces lower but more accurate totals.

Per CEB documentation: "Revenue and expenses amounts reflect data as reported by organizations in their respective financial statements, without adjustments for revenue and/or expenses associated with transfers of funding between UN organizations."
