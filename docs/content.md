1. Under the leadership of the Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), the UN has made significant improvements to financial data standardization and reporting over the past few years (see Data Standards for United Nations: System-Wide Reporting of Financial Data). For this reason, results are not perfectly comparable year-to-year. On this website, we have worked to further standardize even the CEB data (e.g., country/region names). However, sudden changes from year-to-year may still be due to improved data quality rather than changes in actual underlying performance.
2. The number of entities reporting in each period has increased over the past years, and thus the total reported revenue has increased too.
3. The classification of UN Grant revenue instruments has changed over time. For comparability purposes, “voluntary contributions pending earmarking” grants been categorized as “voluntary non-core (earmarked) contributions”.
4. The classification of UN System Functions has changed over time. For comparability purposes, the previous “normative, treaty-related and knowledge creation activities” and “technical cooperation” functions have been aggregated under the new “global agenda and specialised assistance” function.
5. The allocation rules for headquarters expenditure to geographies has been applied inconsistently. For comparability purposes, we have assigned headquarters expenses under the “global and interregional” category rather than the country in which the expense occurred.
6. The CEB data set classified all Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPO) mission expenditure under the “global and interregional” category. We have approximately allocated these expenses, to the extent possible, to the country in which each mission occurred using the percentage of the budget allocated to each mission as per the DPO. Expenses incurred in disputed territories were allocated to one country/region purely for visualization purposes: UNDOF to the Syrian Arab Republic, UNISFA to Sudan (the), and UNMIK to Kosovo (Security Council Resolution 1244). These allocations are not meant to be official UN positions on borders.
7. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on any map shown do not implyofficial endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.
