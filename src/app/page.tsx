                  <p className="text-sm">
                    Revenue figures combine CEB data on government and non-government contributors.
                    For 2021 onwards, contributors are categorized by type (Governments, Foundations,
                    Private Sector, Multilateral Organizations, etc.) using the CEB&apos;s contributor
                    classification system. For earlier years, contributor categories are partially
                    available. Where specific donors are not identified, contributions are shown as
                    aggregated totals (e.g., &ldquo;Other Foundations&rdquo;).

                    Expenses figures use CEB data as the primary source, covering 48+ UN entities.
                    For years 2019-2023, we integrate UN Secretariat data to break down the &ldquo;UN&rdquo; and
                    &ldquo;UN-DPO&rdquo; aggregates into their constituent departments and peacekeeping missions
                    (150+ sub-entities). Note that CEB figures aggregate individual entity statements without
                    adjusting for inter-agency transfers, while Secretariat data is consolidated and eliminates
                    internal transfers, resulting in slightly lower but more accurate totals.

                      Under the leadership of the Chief Executives Board for
                      Coordination (CEB), the UN has made significant
                      improvements to financial data standardization and
                      reporting over the past few years. For this reason,
                      results are not perfectly comparable year-to-year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The number of entities reporting in each period has
                      increased over the past years, and thus the total reported
                      revenue has increased too.

                    <li>
                      The classification of UN Grant revenue instruments has
                      changed over time. For comparability purposes,
                      &ldquo;voluntary contributions pending earmarking&rdquo;
                      grants have been categorized as &ldquo;voluntary non-core
                      (earmarked) contributions&rdquo;.

                    <li>
                      The classification of UN System Functions has changed over
                      time. For comparability purposes, the previous
                      &ldquo;normative, treaty-related and knowledge creation
                      activities&rdquo; and &ldquo;technical cooperation&rdquo;
                      functions have been aggregated under the new &ldquo;global
                      agenda and specialised assistance&rdquo; function.

                      The allocation rules for headquarters expenditure to
                      geographies has been applied inconsistently. For
                      comparability purposes, we have assigned headquarters
                      expenses under the &ldquo;global and interregional&rdquo;
                      category rather than the country in which the expense
                      occurred.

                      The CEB data set classified all Department of Peacekeeping

                      &ldquo;global and interregional&rdquo; category. We have
                      approximately allocated these expenses, to the extent
                      possible, to the country in which each mission occurred
                      using the percentage of the budget allocated to each
                      mission as per the DPO.

                    Achieving the SDGs by 2030 calls for transformative,
                    collaborative action. However, funding patterns have been
                    characterized by a decline in core resources relative to
                    overall funding, unpredictability, and a rising share of
                    tightly earmarked funds for specific activities.
